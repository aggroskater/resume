# The Involvement

This is the stuff that I'm passionate about. These are the things I put effort 
into and learn for no better reason than "because." Because technology is 
awesome and community is important. But also because I really enjoy putting
development and dev-ops tools into practice and believe that automation can
be useful __outside__ the datacenter, too.
